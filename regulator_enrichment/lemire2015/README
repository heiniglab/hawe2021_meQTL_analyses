# list of trans regulators
# We manually extracted the list of regulators from supplementary table 4 of the paper
# (first column) and copied it without further processing to:
# 'epigenetic_trans_regulators.txt'

# nrg2538-s3.txt
# This file was downloaded from the paper "A census of human transcription factors: function, expression and evolution",
# by Vaquerizas et al. 2009 . It contains a list of manually curated transcription factors used in lemire
# et al. 2015 for the evaluation of their SNP loci
# The 'x' classified TFs are low confidence/probably no TFs according to the supplement,
# so we remove them (also, they make problems when trying to read them in in R)
grep '^x' -v nrg2538-s3.txt > nrg2538-s3-no-x.txt

# To get the list of TFs for which to enrich, we extract classes 'a' and 'b' of the
# provided file. This gave the most similar number of TFs... (we cant reproduce the Lemire number
# of 1225 loci encoding TFs)
